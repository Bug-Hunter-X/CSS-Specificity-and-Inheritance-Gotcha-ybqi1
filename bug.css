The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.container div {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.container p {
  font-size: 14px;
  color: blue;
}

.container p span {
  color: red;
}

.container .special-paragraph {
  font-size: 20px;
  color: green;
}
```

The issue lies in the specificity and inheritance behavior of the selectors. The `.container p span` selector, while seemingly straightforward, won't override the color inheritance from its parent due to specificity rules. The `p` element's `color: blue;` declaration is more specific than the `span` element's `color: red;` declaration in this context, and thus the `span` element inherits the `blue` color instead of applying `red`.  This is because the selector `div .container p span` is less specific than `.container p`, causing the inheritance to prioritize.

Another potential problem is unexpected behavior with the `font-size`. If you apply a `font-size` to the div inside the container, it is possible that the selector may be less specific than the parent div's declaration. Thus you may not see the expected font size changes if a specific element does not inherit from the container class.
